# Gravity Forms + Stripe
http://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-stripe/

[Stripe](https://stripe.com) allows you to process credit cards directly on your site, securely and easily, without having to deal with merchant accounts, PCI-compliance, or PayPal.

This [Gravity Forms](http://naomicbush.com/getgravityforms) add-on integrates Stripe with your forms using [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js) to make sure sensitive card information never hits your server.

## Support
* Although I am unable to provide free support, **full, paid support is available at [gravity+](https://gravityplus.pro)**. I am very happy to help.
* Also, neither Gravity Forms nor Stripe provides support for this plugin.
* If you think you've found a bug, or you're not sure if you need to purchase support, feel free to [contact me](https://gravityplus.pro/).

## Current Limitations
* Cannot have Stripe Add-On "activated" at the same time as Authorize.Net or PayPal Pro Add-Ons
* For security reasons, credit card field has to be on the last page of a multi-page form
* One Stripe form per page

## Reported Conflicts

* plugin: Shortcodes Ultimate
* plugin: PHP Shortcode Version 1.3
* theme: Themeforest themes that strip shortcodes
* plugin: Root Relative URLs

## Installation

1. Make sure that Gravity Forms is activated
2. Upload `gravityforms-stripe` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Add your Stripe API keys to the Stripe tab on the Settings page (Forms->Settings).
5. Create a form, adding at least one product field along with the new 'Credit Card' field that appears under 'Pricing Fields.' Keep in mind that Stripe accepts a minimum charge of $0.50 - this means that the total amount of your form must be at least $0.50.
6. Under Forms->Stripe, add a Stripe feed for your new form.
